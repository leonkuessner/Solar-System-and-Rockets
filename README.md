Accurately map planets and orbits of the Solar System. 

Data in Data2 (less accurate for non-sweep models) and Data3 (More accurate + comets + sweep) from JPL (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planet_phys_par)

Equations: 
  Kepler III: Find Radii at angle theta, find Semi Minor Axis for given Semi Major Axis and Eccentricity
  Kepler II:  Find the deltaTheta with ellipse area, deltaTime (which I set), Period of Orbit, distance from focus
  

Units:
  Semi Major Axis: AU
  Mass -------------------------- Earth Masses (Might change to kg)
  Period of ROTATION (P_rot) ---- Earth Days
  Period of ORBIT (P_orb) ------- Earth Years (Might change to days)
  Radius ------------------------ Earth Radii
  Orbital Inclination ----------- Degrees (Might change to radii)
  
  
Todo: 

Allow different Foci
Set Colors of different colors during FuncAnimation
